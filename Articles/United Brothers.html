      <p>The  United Brothers Society was formed in <a href="./1806.html">1806</a> by students who had not been admitted to the only existing society for debate and literary improvement, the <a href="./Philermenian Society.html">Philermenian Society</a>. They held their first meetings in Room No. 6, <a href="./University Hall.html">University Hall</a>, at midnight, without a light, and with guards at the door, to insure the secrecy of their plan. After their constitution was approved by <a href="./President.html">President</a> Messer in April <a href="./1806.html">1806</a>, the society raised $120 for books for its library. The Philermenians found out about the new society when a box of books arrived at the College, directed to the “Secretary of the United Brothers Society,” and immediately sent a committee to <a href="./President.html">President</a> Messer to ask him to suppress the society, only to learn that the society already had his approval. Among the founding members of the society were <a href="./Marcy, William L..html">William L. Marcy</a> <a href="./1808.html">1808</a>, Dutee J. Pearce <a href="./1808.html">1808</a>, Jonathan Going <a href="./1809.html">1809</a>, and Daniel Frost <a href="./1808.html">1808</a>. The United Brothers Society was a Republican group with views differing from the Federalist Philermenians. It held its own exercises until <a href="./1841.html">1841</a>, when the United Brothers and the Philermenians began to have a joint celebration, at which the Brothers wore white ribbons to distinguish them from the Philermenians. After <a href="./1859.html">1859</a> there were few meetings of the United Brothers except for initiations, and the joint anniversaries ended in <a href="./1863.html">1863</a>.</p>
