      <p>The Crucible was a club formed in <a href="./1910.html">1910</a> at the Women’s College to discuss “serious problems of interest to college women.” Membership was limited to fifteen juniors and seniors, selected with the advice of the faculty. The club came to be viewed as too exclusive, even by the members, who voted in <a href="./1917.html">1917</a> to reorganize as a subcommittee of the College Forum and relinquished their separate existence in <a href="./1918.html">1918</a>.</p>
