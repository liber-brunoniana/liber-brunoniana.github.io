      <p>Alumnae Hall on the Pembroke <a href="./Campus.html">Campus</a> was dedicated on October 11, <a href="./1927.html">1927</a>. Funds for the building had been raised through the efforts of the <a href="./Alumnae Association.html">Alumnae Association</a> which initiated its campaign at its annual meeting in June <a href="./1923.html">1923</a>, when it was announced that Stephen O. Metcalf would duplicate all gifts of students and alumnae. The campaign continued until <a href="./1926.html">1926</a>, when the $50,000 contributed by the students and the $150,000 contributed by the alumnae, together with Mr. Metcalf’s matching funds, were deemed sufficient to start the building. The cornerstone was laid on May 11, <a href="./1926.html">1926</a>. Andrews, Jones, Biscoe and Whitmore of Boston were the architects and Charles B. Maguire Company of Providence the contractor. The final cost of the building came to $425,000. It was informally opened in April <a href="./1927.html">1927</a> to ease the overcrowding of <a href="./Pembroke Hall.html">Pembroke Hall</a>. Alumnae Hall, built of brick with limestone trim, was designed to accommodate the social and religious activities of the Women’s College. Its main entrance is a balustraded stone terrace on the campus leading to an auditorium on the main floor. When the building was opened a large organ was installed, the gift of Mrs. C. Prescott Knight and Mrs. Webster Knight in memory of their sister-in-law, Edith Knight. A reception room with a large fireplace on the first floor was the gift of the Rhode Island Society for the Collegiate <a href="./Education.html">Education</a> of Women. A dining room was located in the basement and the third floor was occupied by the headquarters of the college organizations and a sitting room for commuting students. When “The Gate,” a snack bar with a white picket fence, was opened in Alumnae Hall in <a href="./1947.html">1947</a>, Pembroke students, who were allowed in the Blue Room in <a href="./Faunce House.html">Faunce House</a> only when escorted by a Brown man, now had a place of their own, where Brown men were welcome, but only when accompanied by a Pembroker.</p>
