      <p>The Orwig <a href="./Music.html">Music</a> Center occupies a building at 1 Young Orchard Avenue, which was built about <a href="./1850.html">1850</a> for Byron Sprague, son of manufacturer Amasa Sprague. After the collapse of the Sprague business in <a href="./1873.html">1873</a>, the house passed into other hands and was eventually purchased by I. Gifford Ladd. At this time the stone-trimmed brick Italianate mansion was remodeled by architects Carrère and Hastings and given a French Renaissance exterior. Later the building was the Hope Hospital, was sold to <a href="./Bryant College.html">Bryant College</a> and named South Hall, and was acquired by Brown in <a href="./1969.html">1969</a> with the purchase of the <a href="./Bryant College.html">Bryant College</a> campus. The music complex was named for Benton B. Orwig ’20 in consideration of a donation by his widow, Virginia Baldwin Orwig. The music library in the new wing built in <a href="./1988.html">1988</a> was named for Mrs. Orwig, and was dedicated on two days in May <a href="./1988.html">1988</a> at exercises featuring a performance by the Charleston String Quartet and an address by Joseph B. Kerman, professor of music at the University of California. When it opened, the new library contained 12,000 recordings, 10,000 scores, and 15,000 books and serials.</p>
