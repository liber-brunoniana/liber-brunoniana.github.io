      <p>Otto Neugebauer (<a href="./1899.html">1899</a>-<a href="./1990.html">1990</a>), professor of the history of mathematics, was born in Innsbruck in Tyrol on May 26, <a href="./1899.html">1899</a>. He studied mathematics and physics at the Universities of Graz and Munich, and was doing doctoral work at the University of Göttingen when he discovered the German translation of James Henry Breasted’s <i><a href="./History.html">History</a> of Egypt,</i> and turned his attention to <a href="./Egyptology.html">Egyptology</a>. He earned his Ph.D. degree at the University of Göttingen in <a href="./1926.html">1926</a>, with a dissertation on Egyptian fractions. He was assistant professor at Göttingen from <a href="./1927.html">1927</a> to <a href="./1933.html">1933</a>, and research professor at the University of Copenhagen from <a href="./1934.html">1934</a> to <a href="./1939.html">1939</a>. When the first publication of scientific cuneiform texts was happening, Neugebauer, realizing that the translators did not understand the mathematics involved, undertook the work himself, and between <a href="./1935.html">1935</a> and <a href="./1938.html">1938</a> published a three-volume edition of Babylonian mathematical texts. Nazi interference with his work in Denmark led him to come to Brown in <a href="./1939.html">1939</a> as professor of mathematics, bringing with him the journal which he was editing and would continue to edit at Brown, <i>Mathematical Reviews.</i> In <a href="./1941.html">1941</a> he was able to bring Abraham Sachs to Brown with a fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation, and together they published <i>Mathematical Cuneiform Texts.</i> When Neugebauer wrote <i>A <a href="./History.html">History</a> of Mathematical <a href="./Astronomy.html">Astronomy</a>,</i> he dedicated it to “the Owl and the Rabbit,” <i>i.e.</i> his colleague Sachs and Sachs’s wife, Janet. Neugebauer himself was affectionately known as “the Elephant.” In <a href="./1945.html">1945</a> Neugebauer and Sachs published <i>Mathematical Cuneiform Texts.</i> Neugebauer was responsible for the founding of the <a href="./History.html">History</a> of <a href="./Mathematics.html">Mathematics</a> Department in <a href="./1947.html">1947</a>. His book, <i>The Exact Sciences in Antiquity,</i> published in <a href="./1951.html">1951</a>, was awarded the Heineman Foundation Prize in <a href="./1952.html">1952</a>, the same year in which his <i>The Babylonian Method for the Computation of the Last Visibilities of Mercury</i> won the John F. Lewis Prize of the <a href="./American Philosophical Society.html">American Philosophical Society</a>. In <a href="./1961.html">1961</a> he was awarded an American Council of Learned Societies prize as one of ten outstanding American university professors who were honored for “distinguished accomplishment in humanistic scholarship.” He was chairman of the <a href="./History.html">History</a> of <a href="./Mathematics.html">Mathematics</a> Department until <a href="./1965.html">1965</a>. He retired in <a href="./1969.html">1969</a>. In <a href="./1975.html">1975</a> he published <i>A <a href="./History.html">History</a> of Ancient Mathematical <a href="./Astronomy.html">Astronomy</a>.</i> He died on February 19, <a href="./1990.html">1990</a> in Princeton, New Jersey. Since <a href="./1954.html">1954</a> he had been associated with the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton. He was a member of the <a href="./American Philosophical Society.html">American Philosophical Society</a>, and was awarded Brown’s highest honor, the <a href="./Rosenberger Medal.html">Rosenberger Medal</a>. On being elected to the American Academy of Science in <a href="./1977.html">1977</a>, he was cited as having had “more influence ... in the progress of mathematics in this century than any other individual.”</p>
