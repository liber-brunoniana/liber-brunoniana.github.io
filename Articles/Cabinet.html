      <p>The Cabinet at 68 Waterman Street, presently the home of the Graphic Services department, is a two-story stucco Greek revival building designed by James C. Bucklin and built in <a href="./1844.html">1844</a> as the “Cabinet” of the Rhode Island Historical Society, the name of which is carved in stone above the entrance. A three-story addition, of which Stone and Carpenter were the architects, was built in <a href="./1891.html">1891</a>.
