      <p>Sharon Osborne Brown (<a href="./1891.html">1891</a>-<a href="./1965.html">1965</a>), professor of <a href="./English.html">English</a>, was born in Calais, Maine, on March 10, <a href="./1891.html">1891</a>. He graduated from Brown in <a href="./1915.html">1915</a>, served as an assistant in the <a href="./English.html">English</a> Department for a year, then taught at Phillips Academy in Andover, at Oregon State College, and served in the army during <a href="./World War I.html">World War I</a>, before coming back to Brown in <a href="./1923.html">1923</a> as assistant professor. He taught Victorian literature, modern poetry, and <a href="./English.html">English</a> composition. He published <i><a href="./Poetry.html">Poetry</a> of Our Times</i> and <i>Essays of Our Times</i> in <a href="./1928.html">1928</a>, and <i>The Engineer’s Manual of <a href="./English.html">English</a></i> and <i>Present Tense</i> in <a href="./1941.html">1941</a>. He was promoted to full professor in <a href="./1945.html">1945</a> and retired in <a href="./1961.html">1961</a>. On a questionnaire about his employment at Brown and other activities, Brown’s reply to the inquiry, “What other services do you perform for the community that might be considered worthy of mention?” was a terse “<a href="./Well.html">Well</a>, I have spent a lifetime trying, in the classroom, to make civilized and cultured citizens for the community.” His last work was to edit an anthology, <i>Two Centuries of Brown Verse,</i> as a bicentennial publication. The work was mostly his, although he turned it over to others in the last year before his death in Providence on December 17, <a href="./1965.html">1965</a>.</p>
