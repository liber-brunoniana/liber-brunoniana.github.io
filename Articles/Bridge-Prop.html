      <p>Bridge-Prop is the title given to the sculpture on the College Green near <a href="./Faunce House.html">Faunce House</a>, executed by Henry Moore and given to the University in <a href="./1974.html">1974</a> by Mr. and Mrs. David Finn of New Rochelle, New York, the parents of three Brown students. The female figure cast in bronze, which weighs over a ton, is in three parts, one leaning against another, the third standing free. Moore, explaining the derivation of the title, noted that “Bridge” meant that, if one looked at the sculpture with its base at eye levels, a series of arches can be seen, and “Prop” was applied to the arm that props up the head and shoulder part against the middle part. Moore visited the campus in May <a href="./1974.html">1974</a> to view the sculpture and officiate at the opening of an exhibition in the <a href="./List Art Building.html">List Art Building</a> of photographs which David Finn had taken of it. Finn published photographs of the sculpture in a book, <i>As the Eye Moves.</i></p>
