      <p>Walter Cochrane Bronson (<a href="./1862.html">1862</a>-<a href="./1928.html">1928</a>), professor of <a href="./English.html">English</a> and author of <i>The <a href="./History.html">History</a> of Brown University, <a href="./1764.html">1764</a>-<a href="./1914.html">1914</a>,</i> was born in Roxbury, Massachusetts, on August 17, <a href="./1862.html">1862</a>. His mother was the daughter of Jeremiah Chaplin <a href="./1799.html">1799</a>, the first president of Waterville (Colby) College. He postponed entering college because of illness and graduated from Brown in <a href="./1887.html">1887</a>. He studied at Harvard Divinity School the next year and did graduate work at Cornell from <a href="./1888.html">1888</a> to <a href="./1890.html">1890</a>. He was appointed Fellow in <a href="./English.html">English</a> Literature at Cornell in <a href="./1889.html">1889</a> and professor of <a href="./English.html">English</a> at DePauw University in <a href="./1890.html">1890</a>.

The <i>Dictionary of American Biography</i> said of him: “His creative tendencies were restrained ... by an acute critical sense, a liking for research, and his genius for teaching. He held it finer to teach great literature than to produce a middling sort.” He edited <i>Poems of William Collins</i> and volumes of <a href="./English.html">English</a> and American poetry and prose, and was the author of <i>A Short <a href="./History.html">History</a> of American Literature</i> in <a href="./1900.html">1900</a>, and <i>The <a href="./History.html">History</a> of Brown University, <a href="./1764.html">1764</a>-<a href="./1914.html">1914</a>,</i> written in the sesquicentennial year of the University. Bronson retired in <a href="./1927.html">1927</a> and traveled to the south of France for his health. He died in Oxford, England, on June 2, <a href="./1928.html">1928</a>.</p>
