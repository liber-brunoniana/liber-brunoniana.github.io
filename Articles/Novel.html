      <p><i>Novel</i> first appeared in the fall of <a href="./1967.html">1967</a>, created by Edward Bloom, Park Honan, and Mark Spilka, all members of the <a href="./English.html">English</a> Department, who recognized the need for an academic journal to encourage the study of fiction as a genre. Honan suggested that the journal be called <i>Novel.</i> Bloom provided its subtitle, “A Forum on Fiction,” which emphasizes the purpose of the journal to provide a forum for debate among scholars and to clear what Spilka called in his introduction to the first issue “a veritable log-jam of conflicting theories.” Honan, given a choice of available post office box numbers for the journal, chose “<a href="./1984.html">1984</a>,” and the title of the opening announcement by Spilka in the first issue was “On Box <a href="./1984.html">1984</a>.” When he moved to the University of Birmingham in <a href="./1968.html">1968</a>, Park Honan started a British branch of <i>Novel,</i> and with David Lodge, set up a symposium on the Novel in which “nine very active British critics” participated at the Stratford Institute at Stratford-on-Avon on December 7 and 8, <a href="./1968.html">1968</a>. In celebration of the tenth anniversary of the periodical, a conference was held as part of the festivities connected with the inauguration of <a href="./President.html">President</a> Swearer in April of <a href="./1977.html">1977</a>. The conference featured readings by John Gardner and Gail Godwin and two afternoon panel discussions. Edward Bloom was succeeded as senior editor by Mark Spilka in <a href="./1987.html">1987</a>.</p>
