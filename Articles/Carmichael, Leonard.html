      <p>Leonard Carmichael (<a href="./1898.html">1898</a>-<a href="./1973.html">1973</a>), professor of psychology, was born in Philadelphia on November 9, <a href="./1898.html">1898</a>. His early education was at the Germantown Friends School. He received his bachelor of science degree from Tufts College in <a href="./1921.html">1921</a>. He was an assistant in the department of biology at Tufts during his senior year and continued as an instructor while he pursued his graduate education in psychology at Harvard, receiving his Ph.D. degree in <a href="./1924.html">1924</a>. He studied in Berlin with a Sheldon Travelling Fellowship, then taught psychology at Princeton as an instructor from <a href="./1924.html">1924</a> to <a href="./1926.html">1926</a> and as assistant professor in <a href="./1926.html">1926</a>-27. He came to Brown from Princeton as assistant professor in <a href="./1927.html">1927</a> at the invitation of Vice-<a href="./President.html">President</a> <a href="./Mead, Albert D..html">Albert D. Mead</a>. Carmichael, still in his 20s, was, in his own words, “amazed and honored when he invited me to become the Director of the Psychological Laboratory.” The new laboratory was to be converted from a dwelling at 89 Waterman Street with, as Mead mentioned, a loss of rental income to the University. Carmichael obligingly moved in with the lab as a tenant and lived there until his marriage. He left Brown in <a href="./1936.html">1936</a> to become chairman of the Department of <a href="./Psychology.html">Psychology</a> and dean of the <a href="./Faculty.html">Faculty</a> of Arts and Sciences at the University of Rochester. In <a href="./1938.html">1938</a>, at the age of 39, he became the seventh president of Tufts College. During the second World War he was director of the National Roster of Scientific and Specialized Personnel, which kept track of scientists who were regarded as prospects for mobilization for wartime projects. Of his 300 nights sleeping in trains between Washington and Tufts during this time he concluded, “the human brain can stand a good deal of shaking.” In <a href="./1953.html">1953</a> he became the seventh secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, which he guided through eleven years of expansion and renovation which enhanced its image as a modern institution. He retired in <a href="./1964.html">1964</a>. Throughout his life he carried on a correspondence with Professor <a href="./Carberry, Josiah S..html">Josiah Carberry</a> (q.v.). He died on September 16, <a href="./1973.html">1973</a>, in Washington.</p>
