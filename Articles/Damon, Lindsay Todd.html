      <p>Lindsay Todd Damon (<a href="./1871.html">1871</a>-<a href="./1940.html">1940</a>), professor of <a href="./English.html">English</a>, was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, on November 8, <a href="./1871.html">1871</a>. He graduated in <a href="./1894.html">1894</a> from Harvard, where he remained as assistant in <a href="./English.html">English</a> from <a href="./1894.html">1894</a> to <a href="./1896.html">1896</a>. After a year as instructor in <a href="./English.html">English</a> at Brown, he held the same position at the University of Chicago until <a href="./1901.html">1901</a>, when he returned to Brown as associate professor of rhetoric. He became professor of <a href="./English.html">English</a> in <a href="./1905.html">1905</a> and succeeded to head of the <a href="./English.html">English</a> Department in <a href="./1927.html">1927</a> on the retirement of Professor <a href="./Bronson, Walter C..html">Walter C. Bronson</a>. At the time Alfred H. Gurney ‚Äô07 contrasted the two men îÇø the physically delicate Bronson who disapproved of emphasis on athletics, and Damon, Harvard crew member in his youth, who ‚Äútrue to his early training and inclinations, maintains his interest in rowing, and football and tennis, too, and has no qualms about not meeting classes on the day of a big football game.‚Äù <a href="./Kapstein, I. J..html">I. J. Kapstein</a> ‚Äô26 described the impact of Damon‚Äôs teaching:</p><blockquote>‚ÄúDamon loved to read from Swinburne and it wouldn‚Äôt take him long to warm up to his task. His face would get red, his white hair would fly, and he would roll out those lines like an actor on a stage. Sometimes right in the middle of a reading the students would catch the fever of the moment and show their appreciation by stamping their feet in unison until one would think the old floor was going to go crashing down.‚Äù</blockquote>With Robert Herrick he wrote <i>Composition and Rhetoric,</i> a standard textbook. After the death of his first wife, he married Bertha Clark ‚Äô05, who had formerly been married to Arthur Upham Pope ‚Äô04. Damon retired in <a href="./1936.html">1936</a>. He died on May 6, <a href="./1940.html">1940</a> in the Hyde Park Hotel in New York City. The memorial minute of the faculty described him as ‚ÄúForthright and picturesque in speech, witty in repartee, shrewd in counsel, charitable in judgment, impulsive in action ... He had a quick sympathy for young men and was generous in helping them: many are indebted to him for assistance which shaped their entire lives.‚Äù
