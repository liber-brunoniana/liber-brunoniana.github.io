      <p>Ralph Mason Blake (<a href="./1889.html">1889</a>-<a href="./1950.html">1950</a>), professor of philosophy, was born in Greenfield, Massachusetts, on July 19, <a href="./1889.html">1889</a>. He graduated from Williams College in <a href="./1911.html">1911</a> and earned A.M. and Ph.D. degrees at Harvard in <a href="./1912.html">1912</a> and <a href="./1915.html">1915</a>. He was instructor in philosophy at Princeton from <a href="./1915.html">1915</a> to <a href="./1917.html">1917</a>, acting professor at Wells College for one year, and was named assistant professor at the University of Washington in <a href="./1919.html">1919</a>. He was visiting professor at the University of Chicago in <a href="./1927.html">1927</a>, at Harvard in <a href="./1928.html">1928</a>, and at Columbia in <a href="./1941.html">1941</a>. He came to Brown as professor in <a href="./1930.html">1930</a> and taught until his death in Providence on April 15, <a href="./1950.html">1950</a>. Professor C. J. Ducasse described Blake in a memorial minute:</p><blockquote>“His knowledge of the history of philosophy, and especially of medieval philosophy, was extraordinarily extensive, minute, accurate, and independent. But he was interested also and highly competent in the several main fields of systematic philosophy.... Many remarked on his unusual capacity to project himself for the time being into the points of view of the philosophers whose doctrines he expounded. Even when he personally disagreed with them, no advocate could have been more scrupulously faithful to their thought than he was, or have presented it more sympathetically and plausibly.” </blockquote>
