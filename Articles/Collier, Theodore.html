      <p>Theodore Collier (<a href="./1874.html">1874</a>-<a href="./1963.html">1963</a>), professor of history, was born in Montville, New Jersey, on July 9, <a href="./1874.html">1874</a>. He received a bachelor’s degree in <a href="./1894.html">1894</a> and a master’s degree in <a href="./1897.html">1897</a>, both from Hamilton College. He studied at Union Theological Seminary from <a href="./1899.html">1899</a> to <a href="./1902.html">1902</a> and at the Universities of Berlin and Marburg in <a href="./1903.html">1903</a>-04. He earned his Ph.D. degree from Cornell in <a href="./1907.html">1907</a>. Along the way he acquired teaching experience in a number of secondary schools, Pritchett Institute in Missouri, Englewood School for Boys in New Jersey, and the Manual Training High School in Brooklyn. He was at Williams College from <a href="./1905.html">1905</a> to <a href="./1911.html">1911</a> as instructor and later assistant professor of history, and came to Brown in <a href="./1911.html">1911</a> as associate professor. He was professor of European history from <a href="./1917.html">1917</a> to <a href="./1923.html">1923</a>, professor of history and international relations from <a href="./1923.html">1923</a> to <a href="./1944.html">1944</a>, and head of the Department of <a href="./History.html">History</a> from <a href="./1917.html">1917</a> to <a href="./1939.html">1939</a>. He served with the Y.M.C.A overseas service in France in <a href="./1918.html">1918</a>-19. He also taught at summer sessions at Middlebury College, Clark University and Columbia University, and during the academic year <a href="./1924.html">1924</a>-25 was a visiting professor at Constantinople College. From the time of his arrival at Brown until <a href="./1918.html">1918</a> his name was listed among the faculty as “Theodore Frelinghuysen Collier.” Then he dropped his middle name. In the early 1930s he traveled in Europe, observing political, economic, and social conditions, and frequently lectured on these topics. When he retired from Brown in <a href="./1944.html">1944</a> at the age of 70, he said that what he would miss most was “the direct contact and association with young minds which is the great delight and reward of a teacher’s life.” It was not long before he was involved with students again. In <a href="./1945.html">1945</a> he became a professor of business at Rollins College in Florida, remaining in that position until <a href="./1952.html">1952</a>. He died on April 9, <a href="./1963.html">1963</a> in Tryon, North Carolina.</p>
