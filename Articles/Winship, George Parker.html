He graduated from Somerville Latin School, and in <a href="./1893.html">1893</a> from Harvard University, where he received his master’s degree the next year. He was employed in <a href="./1895.html">1895</a> to catalogue and take charge of the private library of John Carter Brown <a href="./1816.html">1816</a>. When the library was given to Brown University in <a href="./1904.html">1904</a> and the John Carter Brown <a href="./Library.html">Library</a> built to house it, Winship came along and remained as librarian until <a href="./1915.html">1915</a>. At that time he became the librarian of the Widener <a href="./Library.html">Library</a>, which had been given to Harvard as a memorial by the mother of Harry Elkins Widener, a book collector, who was lost when the Titanic sank in <a href="./1912.html">1912</a>. On his departure from Providence, Winship was honored by his literary colleagues, Herbert O. Brigham <a href="./1899.html">1899</a>, Howard M. Chapin ’08, William Eaton Foster <a href="./1873.html">1873</a>, and <a href="./Koopman, Harry Lyman.html">Harry Lyman Koopman</a>, at a dinner at the University Club.

Winship was later appointed assistant librarian of rare books at Harvard and also taught a course on the history of printing. His father, Albert Edward Winship, was editor of the <i>Journal of <a href="./Education.html">Education</a>,</i> and his brother, Lawrence L. Winship, was managing editor of the <i>Boston Globe.</i> After his retirement in <a href="./1936.html">1936</a> he printed pamphlets on his small press at home. He died on June 22, <a href="./1952.html">1952</a> in Dover, Massachusetts.</p>
