In college he wrote for the literary supplement of the <i>Brown Daily Herald,</i> contributed to the book review page of the <i><a href="./Brown Jug.html">Brown Jug</a>,</i> and was editor of <i><a href="./Casements.html">Casements</a>.</i> After graduation in <a href="./1926.html">1926</a> Kapstein, with a literary career in mind, moved to New York and worked for Alfred Knopf, publisher, where he was assigned to the textbook department. He and <a href="./Perelman, S. J..html">S. J. Perelman</a> roomed together in a Greenwich Village flat, and wrote short stories which did not sell.</p><p>In <a href="./1928.html">1928</a> he was brought back to Brown by invitation of Professor <a href="./Benedict, George W..html">George W. Benedict</a> as an instructor in <a href="./English.html">English</a>, and earned his master’s degree in <a href="./1929.html">1929</a> and his Ph.D. in <a href="./1931.html">1931</a>.

Korn ’65 as a tribute to his “friend and counselor,” crediting Kapstein, with whom he had never taken a course, as being the person who encouraged him when he thought of dropping out of college. In <a href="./1982.html">1982</a> a former student, Marvyn Carton ’38, established the Israel J. Kapstein Professorship.
