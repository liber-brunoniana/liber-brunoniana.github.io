      <p>The <i>Liber Brunensis</i> for <a href="./1870.html">1870</a> appeared in December <a href="./1869.html">1869</a>, superseding the <i><a href="./Brown Paper.html">Brown Paper</a>,</i> an annual newspaper published by the secret societies. Still a publication of the secret societies, the first <i>Liber Brunensis</i> was a pamphlet of fifty-eight pages which printed membership lists of the various organizations and included class lists. The <i>Liber</i> grew in size and was illustrated by drawings, cartoons, and caricatures. The <a href="./1890.html">1890</a> volume included group photographs of publication boards, musical clubs and athletic teams. Individual photographs of seniors first appeared in the <a href="./1896.html">1896</a> <i>Liber.</i> Since <a href="./1857.html">1857</a> seniors had been accustomed to purchase large leather-bound class albums into which they inserted photographs of individual classmates as well as campus views and group photographs. Even when the <i>Liber</i> began to include photographs, the class albums continued their existence until <a href="./1907.html">1907</a>. In <a href="./1895.html">1895</a> the <i>Liber</i> included lists of women students in a section headed “Co-<a href="./Education.html">Education</a>.” The next year there were pictures of individual women graduates, and in <a href="./1897.html">1897</a> lists of sorority members. From <a href="./1902.html">1902</a> until <a href="./1907.html">1907</a> the <i>Liber</i> contained class lists of women students and pages devoted to the sororities and other women’s organizations and teams. In <a href="./1908.html">1908</a> the women’s pages disappeared, and in <a href="./1909.html">1909</a> the Women’s College started its own annual, <i><a href="./Brun Mael.html">Brun Mael</a>,</i> which was published until <a href="./1970.html">1970</a>, after which the <i>Liber Brunensis</i> became the yearbook of the coeducational institution brought about by the merger of Brown and Pembroke. The <i>Liber</i> of <a href="./1919.html">1919</a> was the last to be published by a senior board of editors, who were representatives of their fraternities. The next year there was a smaller board of editors, which included some members of the junior class. The <i>Liber</i> has continued to be published annually, except when prevented by wartime conditions in <a href="./1944.html">1944</a>. A combined <a href="./1944.html">1944</a>-<a href="./1945.html">1945</a> book was issued the following year.</p>
