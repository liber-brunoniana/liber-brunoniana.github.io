      <p>Urban Studies became recognized when <a href="./President.html">President</a> Hornig established a Committee on Urban Studies with Professor Benjamin Chinitz as chairman in July <a href="./1971.html">1971</a>. Before that time several departments, such as <a href="./Political Science.html">Political Science</a>, <a href="./Sociology.html">Sociology</a>, <a href="./History.html">History</a>, and <a href="./Economics.html">Economics</a>, already had urban-oriented courses, and the Division of <a href="./Engineering.html">Engineering</a> had a concentration in urban technology. The new committee’s job was to initiate courses in urban studies and to counsel students in developing independent concentrations. In the spring of <a href="./1972.html">1972</a> the committee sponsored a lecture series, “Campaign ’72: The Urban <a href="./Issues.html">Issues</a>.” Six members of the committee cooperated in an extension course called “Urban America: Problems and Perspectives.” Ten students graduated with an independent concentration in urban studies in <a href="./1972.html">1972</a>, and twenty in <a href="./1973.html">1973</a>. A standard concentration in urban studies was approved in <a href="./1973.html">1973</a>, and a revised concentration program in <a href="./1975.html">1975</a>. The Urban Analysis Group, an interdepartmental research team was funded by grants from the National Science Foundation and the Economic Development Administration. Professor <a href="./Zimmer, Basil G..html">Basil Zimmer</a> of <a href="./Sociology.html">Sociology</a> reorganized the Urban Studies Program in <a href="./1974.html">1974</a> and was chairman until <a href="./1986.html">1986</a>. J. Vernon Henderson, professor of economics, became Director of Urban Studies in <a href="./1986.html">1986</a>. The core program curriculum includes courses in art, economics, history, political science, and sociology. Concentrators in urban studies also participate in off-campus work-study programs.</p>
