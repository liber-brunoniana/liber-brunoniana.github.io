      <p>Detlev Walther Schumann (<a href="./1900.html">1900</a>-<a href="./1986.html">1986</a>), professor of German, was born in Kiel, Germany, on May 20, <a href="./1900.html">1900</a>. After receiving a Ph.D. degree from the University of Hamburg in <a href="./1923.html">1923</a> he taught in secondary schools in Germany until <a href="./1926.html">1926</a>, when he came to the United States. He taught at Bowdoin College from <a href="./1926.html">1926</a> to <a href="./1929.html">1929</a>, at Lincoln School of Teachers College at Columbia from <a href="./1929.html">1929</a> to <a href="./1931.html">1931</a>, at the University of Missouri from <a href="./1931.html">1931</a> to <a href="./1934.html">1934</a>, and at Swarthmore College from <a href="./1934.html">1934</a> to <a href="./1935.html">1935</a>. In <a href="./1935.html">1935</a> he came to Brown as assistant professor of German, and was promoted to associate professor in <a href="./1936.html">1936</a> and professor in <a href="./1946.html">1946</a>. He left Brown in <a href="./1949.html">1949</a> to teach at the University of Illinois, where he remained until <a href="./1957.html">1957</a>. He taught at the University of Pennsylvania from <a href="./1957.html">1957</a> to <a href="./1962.html">1962</a>. When an opportunity to return to Brown as chairman of the German Department arose in <a href="./1962.html">1962</a>, Schumann found himself taking a sentimental trip back to where he wanted to be, “in <a href="./Marston Hall.html">Marston Hall</a>, which still had exactly the same musty (somewhat pleasantly musty!) smell as of yore, an odor by which I would identify it if I were left there blind-folded after years of rotating in outer space.” In <a href="./1964.html">1964</a> he received the Medal of Merit First Class, one of the highest medals of the German government, for promoting student exchanges between Brown and the University of Kiel, for the quality of his scholarship and teaching in German studies, and for the contributions to German culture afforded by dissertations supervised by him. In <a href="./1965.html">1965</a> Schumann represented Brown at the tercentenary of the University of Kiel, on which occasion he was made an “Ehrenbürger,” or Honorary Fellow of the University. He was chairman of the German Department until <a href="./1965.html">1965</a>, and retired from Brown in <a href="./1970.html">1970</a>. He died in Providence on December 29, <a href="./1986.html">1986</a>.</p>
