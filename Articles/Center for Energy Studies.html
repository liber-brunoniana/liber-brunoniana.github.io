      <p>The Center for Energy Studies was started in <a href="./1976.html">1976</a> to coordinate the various types of energy research going on at Brown and to encourage communication leading to new research and programs. “Energy Week” that year brought to the campus experts to debate on “Nuclear Energy Safety” and “Economic Aspects of U.S. Energy Policy.” Professor Joseph Kestin, an authority on geothermal energy, was named director of the center. <a href="./Faculty.html">Faculty</a> from several departments were members of the executive committee, which instituted programs in Independent Studies leading to a bachelor of science or a bachelor of arts degree with concentration in Energy and promoted a departmental energy concentration in the Division of <a href="./Engineering.html">Engineering</a>. The Center is last mentioned in the University catalogue for <a href="./1983.html">1983</a>-85, and was dissolved during that time.</p>
