He was instructor in Greek and Latin classics at Brown in <a href="./1927.html">1927</a>-28 and again in <a href="./1932.html">1932</a>, becoming assistant professor in <a href="./1935.html">1935</a>, associate professor in <a href="./1944.html">1944</a>, and professor in <a href="./1951.html">1951</a>.

With Professor <a href="./Bradner, Leicester.html">Leicester Bradner</a> he translated <i>The Latin Epigrams of Thomas More,</i> which was published by the University of Chicago Press in <a href="./1953.html">1953</a>, after which he was invited to become a member of the Thomas More Project at Yale University.
