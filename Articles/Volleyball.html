      <p>Volleyball was played by a coed team in <a href="./1971.html">1971</a>, which won every game in its first varsity season. Joan Taylor was the first coach of women’s volleyball. Under coach Cathy Fulford, who came in <a href="./1978.html">1978</a>, the teams progressed from a 7-17 first year record in <a href="./1978.html">1978</a> through five 20-win seasons from <a href="./1980.html">1980</a> to <a href="./1984.html">1984</a> to the <a href="./Ivy League.html">Ivy League</a> championship in <a href="./1988.html">1988</a>, becoming the first team other than Princeton or Penn to win since volleyball became a League sport in <a href="./1977.html">1977</a>. In the opening round of the ECAC tournament the team lost to Hofstra, the winner of the tournament. In <a href="./1990.html">1990</a> the team won the Rutgers Invitational and was second at Brown’s invitational and the Drexel Tournament, but finished fifth in the <a href="./Ivy League.html">Ivy League</a> tournament. Funding for women’s volleyball as a varsity sport was withdrawn in <a href="./1991.html">1991</a> as part of the University’s budget reduction. The difficulties connected with this decision did not prevent the volleyball team, now a club sport with a new coach, Dorothy Hert, from reaching the finals of the <a href="./Ivy League.html">Ivy League</a> championship tournament, where the team lost to Cornell.</p>
