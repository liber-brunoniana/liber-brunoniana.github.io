      <p>East Building was part of a double house of Meeting Street, which was pressed into service as a recitation hall for the women students in <a href="./1913.html">1913</a>, with three classrooms “of such a size that no words of the professor’s melt in distance before they reach the farthermost student.” Student opinion dismissed the building in the <i>Students’ Handbook</i> for <a href="./1917.html">1917</a> as “another one, which is glorified by the name of East Building, but it is a bit of college etiquette not to speak of that.” The second half of the building was renovated in <a href="./1923.html">1923</a>. In <a href="./1935.html">1935</a> the building was still in service and had been treated to fresh paint in bright colors. It was torn down in <a href="./1952.html">1952</a> along with the nearby East House.</p>
