      <p>Albert Arnold Bennett (<a href="./1888.html">1888</a>-<a href="./1971.html">1971</a>), professor of mathematics, was born on June 2, <a href="./1888.html">1888</a> in Yokohama, Japan, where his father, Albert A. Bennett <a href="./1872.html">1872</a>, was a missionary and president of the Baptist Theological Seminary. Young Bennett lived in Japan until he was fourteen, when he was sent to live with relatives in Providence to continue his education. He graduated from Brown in <a href="./1910.html">1910</a> and earned his master of science degree in <a href="./1911.html">1911</a>. He received his Ph.D. from Princeton in <a href="./1915.html">1915</a>, having spent a year at the mathematical center at Göttingen. During <a href="./World War I.html">World War I</a> he was an army captain engaged in mathematical work at Aberdeen Proving Grounds. After the war, he worked for the War Department as a civilian ballistics expert. He taught at the University of Texas and Lehigh University, where he was head of the <a href="./Mathematics.html">Mathematics</a> Department, before coming back to Brown as professor of mathematics in <a href="./1927.html">1927</a>. His special interests were modern algebra and symbolic logic. Because of his initials he was sometimes called “A-squared Bennett.” In <a href="./World War II.html">World War II</a> he was again at Aberdeen Proving Grounds and, after the war, in Tokyo as a ballistics expert, attaining the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.
