      <p>Alumni Field Day became part of the <a href="./Commencement.html">Commencement</a> festivities in <a href="./1958.html">1958</a>. Two years earlier the class of <a href="./1951.html">1951</a> had held a Thayer Field carnival at its reunion. In <a href="./1957.html">1957</a> the classes of <a href="./1949.html">1949</a>, <a href="./1950.html">1950</a>, and <a href="./1951.html">1951</a> joined in a similar celebration of their off-year on-campus reunion in a tent, with activities for the whole family. Alumni Field Day took place in <a href="./1958.html">1958</a> on newly acquired <a href="./Aldrich-Dexter Field.html">Aldrich-Dexter Field</a> with a circus tent for headquarters and a smaller tent for the twenty-fifth reunion class. In time new events were added to the schedule, such as an Old Timersâ€™ baseball game, a rugby match, and swimming in the pool. The event was renamed Brown Field Day in <a href="./1974.html">1974</a>.</p>
