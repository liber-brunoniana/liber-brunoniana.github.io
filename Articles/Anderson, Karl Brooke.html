      <p> K(arl) Brooke Anderson (<a href="./1892.html">1892</a>-<a href="./1975.html">1975</a>), executive secretary of the Brown Christian Association, was born in Cardwell, Virginia, on August 31, <a href="./1892.html">1892</a>. During his southern childhood he had what he called a “hang-up” about “Yankees,” but a shared camping trip with a northern boy when he was 11 convinced him, in the words of his daughter, “that all Yankees didn’t have horns,” and he went on to a life of serving all people. After graduation from the University of Richmond in <a href="./1916.html">1916</a> and graduate work at Cornell, he worked with the French Army Ambulance Service for two years, and was awarded the Silver Star. After the war he joined the YMCA and worked with prisoners in France. He helped rescue homeless Armenians driven into the desert by the Turks and to find them new homes in the United States. In <a href="./1921.html">1921</a> he entered Yale Divinity School. When he graduated in <a href="./1924.html">1924</a>, he chose not to be ordained in any particular faith, as he wanted to work with all young people. From <a href="./1924.html">1924</a> to <a href="./1928.html">1928</a> he was executive secretary of the first college YMCA in the country at the University of Virginia. In <a href="./1928.html">1928</a> he came to Brown as executive secretary of the Brown Christian Association and remained until his retirement in <a href="./1957.html">1957</a>. During those years he was constantly engaged in counseling students and gave his special attention to foreign students. He took two leaves of absence, in <a href="./1947.html">1947</a> to raise money for YMCA work in Europe and Asia, and in <a href="./1949.html">1949</a> to work with Palestine refugees. He retired from Brown in <a href="./1957.html">1957</a>, but remained active, and took part in a Vietnam war demonstration in Newport in <a href="./1971.html">1971</a>. He died on October 18, <a href="./1975.html">1975</a> in Newton Lower Falls, Massachusetts.</p>
