      <p>AIESEC <i>(eye-sec)</i> takes its names from the French acronym for the International Association of Students in <a href="./Economics.html">Economics</a> and Business Management. It was founded by students from seven European countries in <a href="./1948.html">1948</a> to strengthen international relations through the exchange of student workers. Since about <a href="./1959.html">1959</a> Brown has participated in this student-run operation and, as a member of the Rhode Island branch composed of students from Brown, Providence College and Rhode Island College, solicits aid from local corporations to send students abroad as trainees, sponsors conferences and brings speakers from the business world to the campus, holds fruit basket sales to help with expenses, and handles arrangements for the students who become summer trainees in foreign countries.</p>
