      <p>The Pembroke Alumna was the alumnae magazine of <a href="./Pembroke College.html">Pembroke College</a>, which superseded an earlier publication called the <i>Brown Alumnae News Letter.</i> The <i>News Letter</i> had made its first appearance in <a href="./1928.html">1928</a>, the year in which the name of the Women’s College was changed to <a href="./Pembroke College.html">Pembroke College</a>. The first issue, a mimeographed offering of five pages, announced, “This news letter, bulletin, embryonic magazine, what you will, is in the nature of an experiment that we hope will work, a venture that we intend to make permanent.” In its second year, in March <a href="./1929.html">1929</a>, the <i>Brown Alumnae News Letter,</i> “Published by the <a href="./Alumnae Association.html">Alumnae Association</a> of Brown University,” became a printed leaflet of four pages. It continued in this format, growing over the years to eight pages, and from <a href="./1932.html">1932</a> including occasional photographs. The issue for February <a href="./1950.html">1950</a> was a magazine with a photographic cover and a newly acquired title, <i>Pembroke News Letter.</i> The title was occasionally <i>Pembroke News Letter and Alumnae Record,</i> when the honor roll of donors was included. The <i>News Letter</i> was edited by Gertrude Allen McConnell ’10 until her retirement in <a href="./1955.html">1955</a>, and then by Doris Hopkins Stapelton ’28 until <a href="./1957.html">1957</a>. The change of title to <i>Pembroke Alumna</i> took place in October <a href="./1957.html">1957</a>. Editors of the <i>Pembroke Alumna</i> were Polly Welts Kaufman ’51 from October <a href="./1957.html">1957</a> to January <a href="./1968.html">1968</a>, Sally Kappelman Riggs ’62 from April <a href="./1968.html">1968</a> to July <a href="./1971.html">1971</a>, after which the <i>Pembroke Alumna</i> merged with the <i>Brown Alumni Monthly.</i></p>
