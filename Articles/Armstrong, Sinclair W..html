He graduated from Princeton in <a href="./1918.html">1918</a>, served in the Field Artillery in <a href="./World War I.html">World War I</a>, and returned to Princeton to earn his master’s degree in <a href="./1920.html">1920</a>. He taught at St. George’s School in Newport from <a href="./1923.html">1923</a> to <a href="./1928.html">1928</a>. He came to Brown as an instructor in history in <a href="./1930.html">1930</a>, and was promoted to assistant professor in <a href="./1935.html">1935</a>, associate professor in <a href="./1946.html">1946</a>, and full professor in <a href="./1949.html">1949</a>. He received his Ph.D. degree from the University of Wisconsin in <a href="./1935.html">1935</a>. His field was modern European, especially German, history. During <a href="./World War II.html">World War II</a> he was in Washington, London, and Germany with the Office of Strategic Services and the Office of Military Government. At the end of the war, he played a major role in the discovery of German Foreign Office documents relative to Nazi-Russian relations. He was awarded the Medal of Freedom for his work as civilian technical advisor to the commander of the American section of “Operation Goldcup,” which recovered tons of documents hidden by the Nazis. Professor <a href="./Hedges, James B..html">James B. Hedges</a> said of Armstrong, “In the classroom he displayed a rare skill in communicating to others his own deep concern over the world around him. To his students he gave unsparingly of his time and energy; and no appeal to him for aid or counsel ever went unanswered.” During his final illness, he still held conferences at his home with his advanced history students, and devoted students gave many donations of blood. He died in Providence on March 20, <a href="./1959.html">1959</a>.</p>
