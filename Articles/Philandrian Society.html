      <p>The Philandrian Society was a secret society dedicated to the cultivation of friendship, admission to which required the assent of every member. The first meeting of the Rhode Island branch was held on July 3, <a href="./1799.html">1799</a>, the last recorded meeting in November of <a href="./1810.html">1810</a>. Anniversary meetings were held in the area of Taunton, Massachusetts. The constitution of the society decreed that at each quarterly meeting a previously appointed member should deliver “a Lecture on Politeness.” A subsequent revision of the constitution altered this requirement to “A Lecture on any moral or literary subject.”</p>
