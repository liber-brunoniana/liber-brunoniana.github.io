      <p>The College Venture Program began in <a href="./1974.html">1974</a> as a pilot program financed by the Braitmayer Foundation to help students who needed or wanted to drop out of college temporarily. Set up by a consortium of schools, the program was at first operated at Northeastern University. After the pilot program was incorporated as a non-profit organization and Susan Stroud was named director, the operation moved to Brown University in <a href="./1978.html">1978</a> at her request. The program serves ten universities by maintaining a job bank from which students are able to find meaningful employment to make the best use of the time that they “stop out” from their studies, and help them to return to school with some added job experience and a new perspective.</p>
