      <p>The Nathanael Greene Society was a secret society at Brown University active approximately between 2007 and 2012. Their motto was “Pro Deus et Patria et Universitas, in illo ordine”; roughly, “For God and Country and University, in that order.” Between February 24, 2008 and February 24, 2012, the Nathanael Greene Society hosted a website at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110901003123/http://ngsociety.org/">ngsociety.org</a>.<sup><a href="#fn-ngs">1</a></sup> Their website served as the platform for the publication “Merits & Demerits”, lists of individuals (usually students, faculty or staff at Brown) that the Society lauded or shamed. Recipients of Merits were emailed, anonymously, a link to a web form where they could make a statement to the society.<sup><a href="#fn-tomasi">2</a></sup>. Early interations of ngsociety.org included a grant application which could be completed and emailed to the group. Online, the Society received criticism for its apparent conservative bent.<sup><a href="#fn-ig">3</a></sup></p>
