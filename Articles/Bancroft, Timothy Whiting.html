      <p>Timothy Whiting Bancroft (<a href="./1837.html">1837</a>-<a href="./1890.html">1890</a>), professor of <a href="./English.html">English</a>, was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, on March 9, <a href="./1837.html">1837</a>. He graduated from Brown in <a href="./1859.html">1859</a>. He was principal of the high school in Waltham, Massachusetts for two years and for a brief time engaged in business in Boston, taking the place of his brother who had gone to Europe for a year and had died there. He disliked the business world and soon returned to teaching as principal of the high school in Newton. In <a href="./1868.html">1868</a> he became professor of rhetoric and <a href="./English.html">English</a> literature at Brown after the death of Professor Robinson Potter Dunn. His duties were many, teaching logic and elocution in addition to lecturing in <a href="./English.html">English</a> literature and correcting the numerous themes written by increasing numbers of students. All this he performed conscientiously. He wrote poetry and music, and published <i>Historical Outlines of the <a href="./English.html">English</a> Languages,</i> <i>Historical Outlines of American Literature,</i> and <i>Method of <a href="./English.html">English</a> Composition.</i></p><p>He suffered a breakdown in <a href="./1883.html">1883</a> but, after traveling in the South and in Europe, returned to his teaching duties, which became increasingly burdensome. His disappearance in December of <a href="./1890.html">1890</a> was viewed with apprehension and handbills were circulated, offering a fifty dollar reward for information leading to his discovery. Beneath his photograph was this notice:</p><blockquote>“PROFESSOR T. WHITING BANCROFT, Aged 53, about 5 feet 10 inches in height, about 175 pounds weight, grey eyes, Burnside whiskers and mustache nearly white and which are a prominent feature to his identity; his hair is darker. His figure is firm and upright, with his head set well back when walking; spare figure, but by no means thin; chin bare or nearly so. He was dressed with great care and neatness, in dark colors, high crowned derby hat, rough beaver overcoat, a very dark one.<br /><br />He left his home, 13 Greene street, Providence, R.I., at 8 o’clock, on the morning of December 8, <a href="./1890.html">1890</a>, since which time nothing definitely has been ascertained in regard to his whereabouts.”</blockquote>Toward the end of February his body was found in a pond in Cranston.
