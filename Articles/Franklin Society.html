      <p>The Franklin Society was organized in <a href="./1824.html">1824</a>, a year when such a large class entered that the two existing literary debating societies, the <a href="./Philermenian Society.html">Philermenian Society</a> and the <a href="./United Brothers.html">United Brothers</a> Society could not accommodate enough of the entering students. The membership was also augmented by the acceptance of honorary membership by Henry Clay, Thomas Jefferson, John Quincy Adams, and other notable personages. Ten years after its establishment, in <a href="./1834.html">1834</a>, the Franklin Society was dissolved, its library of several hundred volumes was turned over to the College <a href="./Library.html">Library</a>, and in <a href="./1847.html">1847</a> its members were elected in equal proportions into the two older societies.</p>
