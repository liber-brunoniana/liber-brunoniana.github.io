      <p>Clarence Mertou Webster (<a href="./1892.html">1892</a>-<a href="./1959.html">1959</a>), professor of <a href="./English.html">English</a>, was born in Hampton, Connecticut, on September 16, <a href="./1892.html">1892</a>. He graduated from Clark University in <a href="./1915.html">1915</a> and earned a master’s degree from the University of Michigan in <a href="./1916.html">1916</a>. He taught at a number of institutions before earning his Ph.D. at Brown in <a href="./1935.html">1935</a>. His field was 18th century <a href="./English.html">English</a> literature. He left the academic life for a time to pursue free-lance writing, and was a contributing editor of <i>Yankee</i> magazine. A confirmed New Englander himself, he produced two books on Yankee life, <i>Puritans at Home</i> in <a href="./1936.html">1936</a>, and <i>Town Meeting Country</i> in <a href="./1945.html">1945</a>. To help out during the Second World War, he returned to teaching as an instructor in <a href="./English.html">English</a> at Brown, and was promoted to assistant professor in <a href="./1946.html">1946</a> and associate professor in <a href="./1949.html">1949</a>. He was to have been appointed full professor in <a href="./1959.html">1959</a>. He had suffered all his life from gassing during the First World War, and had elected to have a lung removed in hope of improving his condition. On January 24, <a href="./1959.html">1959</a> he died after the operation. In the memorial minute read at the next faculty meeting Professor <a href="./Anderson, George K..html">George K. Anderson</a> praised his courage and said, “even when he was physically most wretched, his mind continued to reach out for something that would be interesting and challenging to his students – if I may quote his affectionate language, ‘something to make the little rascals think.’”</p>
