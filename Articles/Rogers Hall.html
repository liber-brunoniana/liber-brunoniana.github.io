      <p>Rogers Hall was built in <a href="./1862.html">1862</a> through the efforts of Professor <a href="./Hill, Nathaniel P..html">Nathaniel P. Hill</a> which resulted in raising subscriptions of $14,250. The building, described as Italian Gothic, two stories high, fifty by forty feet, with a projection on the east side thirty-five by fifty-five feet and roofs covered with Vermont slates laid in alternate bands of purple and green, was called simply “The Chemical Laboratory.” When an addition was built in <a href="./1900.html">1900</a> and used for other purposes as engineering instruction, the name was changed to Rogers Hall in honor of William Sanford Rogers, donor of $50,000 in <a href="./1872.html">1872</a> to endow the Newport Rogers Professorship of <a href="./Chemistry.html">Chemistry</a>. After the new <a href="./Metcalf Chemical Laboratory.html">Metcalf Chemical Laboratory</a> was built in <a href="./1924.html">1924</a>, the older laboratory was assigned for use for graduate research under Professor C. A. Kraus. In <a href="./1986.html">1986</a> the rear section of the building was razed and replaced by a new classroom building, which was opened in <a href="./1989.html">1989</a> as the Richard and Edna <a href="./Salomon Center for Teaching.html">Salomon Center for Teaching</a>.</p>
