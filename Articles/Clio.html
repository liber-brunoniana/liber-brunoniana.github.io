      <p><i>Clio,</i> subtitled “A journal of history,” appeared in the fall of <a href="./1974.html">1974</a>, announcing that “CLIO is an autonomous organization affiliated with the <a href="./History.html">History</a> Department of Brown University and the Brown University <a href="./History.html">History</a> Society,” committed to the publication of outstanding and controversial works of historical scholarship by Brown undergraduates. The winter <a href="./1980.html">1980</a> issue appeared in a new larger format with one more article added to the usual four. The smaller format was soon restored with additional pages to accommodate up to eight articles. The subject matter ranged from Cicero to City Halls, and the covers progressed from cartoons to photographs and back to cartoons, a number of the recent ones by Gavriel Rosenfeld ’89.</p>
