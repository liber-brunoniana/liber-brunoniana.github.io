      <p> The Arnold Fellowships were established in <a href="./1964.html">1964</a> by Thomas J. Watson, Jr. ’37. Named after <a href="./Provost.html">Provost</a> <a href="./Arnold, Samuel T..html">Samuel T. Arnold</a> ’13, the fellowships provide a stipend for graduating seniors to travel for a year “to broaden his horizons.” With no required travel report, the Arnold Fellows are free to pursue their proposed projects in their own way and even to become sidetracked into a completely different quest. Former Arnold Fellows have found themselves following the footsteps of Alexander the Great, studying government-supported child care systems, interviewing former Irish Republican Army officers, and playing guitar on the streets of Vienna. The fellowships, originally intended for male students, were extended in <a href="./1971.html">1971</a> to include women students, the first of whom was Barbara Reisman ’71.</p>
