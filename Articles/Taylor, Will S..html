      <p>Will Samuel Taylor (<a href="./1882.html">1882</a>-<a href="./1968.html">1968</a>), professor of art, was born in Ansonia, Connecticut, on November 27, <a href="./1882.html">1882</a>. He studied at the Massachusetts State <a href="./Art.html">Art</a> School in Boston and the <a href="./Art.html">Art</a> Students League in New York City. From <a href="./1910.html">1910</a> to <a href="./1912.html">1912</a> he traveled in Alaska and British Columbia to do research in preparation for the series of murals depicting the North Pacific Indian which he painted for the American <a href="./Museum of Natural History.html">Museum of Natural History</a>. While he was executing these paintings between <a href="./1915.html">1915</a> and <a href="./1925.html">1925</a>, he also taught painting at Pratt Institute. In <a href="./1926.html">1926</a> he traveled in Europe to do research for eight murals on the evolution of man for the Morgan Memorial Hall of the <a href="./Museum of Natural History.html">Museum of Natural History</a>. In <a href="./1926.html">1926</a> he also was appointed assistant professor of art and curator of the art collection at Brown. He was promoted to associate professor in <a href="./1931.html">1931</a> and full professor in <a href="./1949.html">1949</a>. He was chairman of the Department of <a href="./Art.html">Art</a> from <a href="./1926.html">1926</a> to <a href="./1949.html">1949</a>. He continued his work on the murals for the Museum, which included representations of the Neolithic Age, the Bronze Age, the Iron Age, the Viking, and the Steel Age. From charcoal sketches he had made he painted the murals in the studio the University provided at the rear of his home on George Street, where his students could observe him at his work, with his stepladder, his lens (for observing the painting in reverse) and his opera glasses (for changing his perspective of the painting). According to Taylor, “In no other way would it be possible to explain and demonstrate so clearly the solution of problems in perspective, scale, design, pattern, composition and color arising in mural painting.” Other mural paintings by Taylor include two in the Providence Street School in Worcester, Massachusetts, and one of the burning of the schooner Gaspee, which he painted for the new building of the Firemen’s Mutual and Union Mutual Insurance Company in Providence in <a href="./1954.html">1954</a>. He retired from teaching in <a href="./1953.html">1953</a>. He died on December 5, <a href="./1968.html">1968</a>, in New London, Connecticut.</p>
