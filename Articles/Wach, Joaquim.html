      <p> Joachim Wach (<a href="./1898.html">1898</a>-<a href="./1955.html">1955</a>), professor of Biblical literature, was born in Chemnitz, Saxony, Germany, on January 25, <a href="./1898.html">1898</a>. He was named Joachim Ernst Adolphe Felix Wach. His father was with the Saxonian government and his mother was a great-granddaughter of composer Felix Mendelssohn. His early schooling took place in Dresden. He enlisted in the German army in <a href="./1916.html">1916</a>, saw action as a cavalry officer, and became aide-de-camp to a district commissioner in “White Russia.” After the war, he pursued his studies between <a href="./1919.html">1919</a> and <a href="./1922.html">1922</a> at the Universities of Munich, Berlin, Freiburg, and Leipzig, where he received his Doctor of <a href="./Philosophy.html">Philosophy</a> degree in <a href="./1922.html">1922</a>. After more work at the University of Heidelberg, he became an instructor at the University of Leipzig. He was made a Professor Extraordinary in <a href="./1929.html">1929</a>, and was awarded a Doctor of Theology degree at Heidelberg in <a href="./1930.html">1930</a>. After leaving Nazi Germany, he came in the fall of <a href="./1935.html">1935</a> to Brown, where, as visiting professor of biblical literature, he taught courses in the sociology of religion, religious philosophies of the Orient, and the nature and principles of religious development. He was named associate professor in <a href="./1939.html">1939</a> and taught until <a href="./1946.html">1946</a>. Raised as a Lutheran, he became an Episcopalian shortly after coming to the United States. He was widely quoted in newspapers six months after his arrival when he expressed surprise at how hard American college students have to work. His publications include <i>Das Verstehn,</i> a three-volume work on the theory of general interpretations, published between <a href="./1926.html">1926</a> and <a href="./1932.html">1932</a>, <i>An Introduction to the <a href="./Sociology.html">Sociology</a> of Religion in <a href="./1932.html">1932</a>, and</i> <i><a href="./Sociology.html">Sociology</a> of Religion</i> in <a href="./1944.html">1944</a>. His travels took him to all the countries in Europe except England, and to North Africa, where he went to observe Mohammedan customs. He continued teaching at Brown until <a href="./1946.html">1946</a>. When Wach, who had first taken out his citizenship papers in <a href="./1938.html">1938</a>, applied for United States citizenship in <a href="./1946.html">1946</a>, his first petition in February was denied and his second in August granted. In the fall of that year he became professor of the history of religions at the University of Chicago. There he was remembered as being always surrounded by students. A colleague said of him, “Appropriately he regards himself a guru ... a combination of father-confessor, protector, and teacher. To him the professor-student relationship was a sacred one.” He died on August 27, <a href="./1955.html">1955</a> in Locarno, Switzerland. His last book, <i>The Comparative Study of Religions,</i> which he was working on when he died, was completed by his sister, Susi Heigl-Wach, and his colleague, Joseph Kitagawa.</p>
