      <p>Benjamin West (<a href="./1730.html">1730</a>-<a href="./1813.html">1813</a>), professor of mathematics and natural history, was born in Rehoboth, Massachusetts, in March of <a href="./1730.html">1730</a>. He had an early aptitude for mathematics and was largely self-educated, borrowing books from his friends. In <a href="./1753.html">1753</a> he moved to Providence and opened a school. When this venture proved unprofitable, he opened a dry-goods store and bookstore, which did not last after the beginning of the <a href="./Revolutionary War.html">Revolutionary War</a>. During the war he manufactured clothes for the troops, and when the war was over, he opened another school. He had in the meantime become well-known as an astronomer. With Joseph Brown he observed the transit of Venus on June 3, <a href="./1769.html">1769</a>, from a platform on an East Side street later named Transit Street. Another street in the area was given the name of Planet Street. The publication by West of <i>An Account of the Observation of Venus upon the Sun the Third Day of June <a href="./1769.html">1769</a></i> and his observation of a comet in July of <a href="./1770.html">1770</a> established his reputation, and he received honorary master of arts degrees from both Harvard and Rhode Island College (Brown) in that year. Two years later he received an honorary degree from Dartmouth.</p><p>West was also well known for his almanacs, the first of which, <i>An Almanack, for the year of our Lord Christ, <a href="./1763.html">1763</a>...,</i> was published by <a href="./Goddard, William Giles.html">William Goddard</a> on Providence’s first printing press. For a Boston edition of the almanac, West took the name Bickerstaff, originated by Jonathan Swift, for his title, <i>Bickerstaff’s Boston Almanac for the Year of Our Lord <a href="./1768.html">1768</a>.</i> Later almanacs, some of which were not of West’s making, continued to bear the Bickerstaff name. In <a href="./1781.html">1781</a> he was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In <a href="./1786.html">1786</a> he was appointed professor of mathematics and astronomy at Rhode Island College, an appointment which was in fact a lectureship and which he did not take up until <a href="./1788.html">1788</a>, after he returned from a year of teaching mathematics at the Protestant Episcopal Academy in Philadelphia. In <a href="./1798.html">1798</a>, his last year at the College, his title was changed to Professor of <a href="./Mathematics.html">Mathematics</a> and Natural <a href="./Philosophy.html">Philosophy</a>. He retired to Newport to open a school for navigation in his home. In <a href="./1802.html">1802</a> he became postmaster of Providence, a post which he held until his death on August 26, <a href="./1813.html">1813</a>.</p>
