      <p>The Center for Alcohol and Addiction Studies was established in <a href="./1982.html">1982</a> by <a href="./President.html">President</a> Swearer, who declared its goal to be a “collaborative research program which encourages the use of multidisciplinary approaches to problems related to the use of alcohol and other drugs.” The program of research and education within the mainstream of the University’s scholarly and clinical programs involves faculty and professional staff from eleven departments and all of the affiliated hospitals.  The director of the Center is David Lewis ’57, M.D., professor of medicine and community health and Donald G. Millar Professor of alcohol and addiction studies. Model programs developed by the Center have been adopted by other colleges and hospitals, and policy studies have been adopted by the State of Rhode Island and have influenced provision of a new long-term care facility. Over sixty faculty and professionals from eleven departments and eight affiliated hospitals participate in the work of the Center. Since <a href="./1985.html">1985</a> the national offices of AMERSA (Association for Medical <a href="./Education.html">Education</a> and Research in Substance Abuse, established in <a href="./1976.html">1976</a>) have been located at Brown. The Center sponsors a post-doctoral training program in alcohol treatment and early intervention and a training institute with faculty development workshops. The Brown University Program in Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Prevention, funded by the U.S. Department of <a href="./Education.html">Education</a>, was coordinated by Jerri Husch from <a href="./1989.html">1989</a>-<a href="./1991.html">1991</a>. The Center publishes it own <i>Brown University Digest of Addiction Theory and Application,</i>and AMERSA’s <i>Substance Abuse.</i></p>
