      <p>The A. Alfred Taubman Center for Public Policy and American Institutions was created in <a href="./1983.html">1983</a> with a two million dollar gift from A. Alfred Taubman, developer of shopping centers and parent of a Brown student. Thomas Anton came from Michigan to direct the program in public policy and be director of the Center. Core courses for concentration, microeconomics, introduction to public policy, statistics, and ethics are part of this new study of how government works. The Center sponsors a Visiting Fellow program in which representatives of business and government hold discussions with students.</p>
