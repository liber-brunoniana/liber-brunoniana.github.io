      <p>Harrison (Harry) Edward Farnsworth (<a href="./1896.html">1896</a>-<a href="./1989.html">1989</a>), professor of physics, was born in Ripon, Wisconsin, on March 24, <a href="./1896.html">1896</a>. He graduated from Ripon College in <a href="./1918.html">1918</a> and earned his A.M. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of Wisconsin in <a href="./1921.html">1921</a> and <a href="./1922.html">1922</a>. His first published paper in <a href="./1922.html">1922</a> reported that some secondary electrons were reflected without loss of energy, an observation which was at first criticized, but later confirmed. He taught at the University of Pittsburgh in <a href="./1918.html">1918</a>-19, was a teaching assistant and research fellow at the University of Wisconsin from <a href="./1919.html">1919</a> to <a href="./1924.html">1924</a> and associate professor at the University of Maine from <a href="./1924.html">1924</a> until <a href="./1926.html">1926</a>, when he came to Brown as assistant professor of physics. He was promoted to associate professor in <a href="./1929.html">1929</a> and professor in <a href="./1946.html">1946</a>. In <a href="./1960.html">1960</a> he was designated a research professor and in <a href="./1963.html">1963</a> was named the Annette L. R. Barstow University Professor. He was chairman of the Department of <a href="./Physics.html">Physics</a> in <a href="./1942.html">1942</a>-43 and a member of the executive committee of the department from <a href="./1954.html">1954</a> to <a href="./1956.html">1956</a>. In <a href="./1941.html">1941</a> he was on leave to work on a war project at M.I.T. The next year he was an investigator for the National Defense Research Council. At various times he was a consultant for the Office of Naval Research, the Brookhaven National Laboratory, and other industrial laboratories. He founded Brownâ€™s laboratory of surface physics. He wrote many technical papers, and was an authority on the physics and chemistry of the surfaces of solids and a pioneer in the use of electrons for the study of metal crystal surfaces. He retired in <a href="./1970.html">1970</a> and moved to Tucson, Arizona, where he set up a laboratory at the University of Arizona, which he later moved to his home, so that he continued his research almost until his death in Tucson on November 14, <a href="./1989.html">1989</a>.</p>
