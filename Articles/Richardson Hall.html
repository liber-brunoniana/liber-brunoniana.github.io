      <p>Richardson Hall, originally named <a href="./Brunonia.html">Brunonia</a> Hall, was built in <a href="./1900.html">1900</a> by Mrs. Mary A. Walworth of Boston as a private dormitory to accommodate 34 students in suites with such amenities as window seats and fireplaces and “Gegenstorm’s shower and needle baths.” Designed by Stone, Carpenter and Wilson, it was built by local contractors Thomas Gilbane and Brother. The dormitory was purchased by the University in <a href="./1920.html">1920</a> to help solve housing problems. In the summer of <a href="./1951.html">1951</a> it was converted to the use of the Graduate Division of Applied <a href="./Mathematics.html">Mathematics</a> and renamed for Roland G. D. Richardson, who initiated the Applied <a href="./Mathematics.html">Mathematics</a> program. After Applied Math acquired new quarters in <a href="./1953.html">1953</a>, the building was once more a dormitory.</p>
