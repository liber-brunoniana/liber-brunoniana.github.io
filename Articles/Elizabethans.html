      <p>Elizabethans was an association founded by women students in October <a href="./1930.html">1930</a>, probably prompted by the formation of the <a href="./Erasmians.html">Erasmians</a>, as the constitution of that organization has been kept in the records of the Elizabethans. The group’s first advisor was Professor Edmund Loughnan, who was called “Mr. Vidam.” In a memorandum apparently prepared for the information of prospective members Elizabethans is described as the “Pembroke Parliamentary Society,” a society of picked members, limited in numbers, named for Queen Elizabeth of England ... modelled on the Oxford Union which is itself a model of the House of <a href="./Commons.html">Commons</a> ... a society which ... has its own unique feature of being run like a royal court of ancient times.” In the same memorandum appears an extract from the constitution, “The Society of Elizabeth is founded and shall continue in unswerving loyalty to the cause of Religion, to the principles of American democracy, and to the <a href="./President.html">President</a> of Brown University.” Meetings were presided over by a Queen, who was advised by a privy council and “Mr. Vidam,” and humorous minutes were presented by the “Lady Keeper of the <a href="./Seal.html">Seal</a>.” Professors <a href="./Bradner, Leicester.html">Leicester Bradner</a> and <a href="./Noyes, Robert Gale.html">Robert Gale Noyes</a> also took the role of “Mr. Vidam.” The organization, more a social than a debating society, came to an end during <a href="./World War II.html">World War II</a>.</p>
