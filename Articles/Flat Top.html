      <p>Flat Top was a particularly unattractive building which was erected on the lower campus between the <a href="./Lincoln Field Building.html">Lincoln Field Building</a> and the <a href="./Metcalf Research Laboratory.html">Metcalf Research Laboratory</a> in <a href="./1946.html">1946</a> for use as a temporary cafeteria building. It was a surplus government building, which acquired its nickname from the fact that, when viewed from the rear of <a href="./Sayles Hall.html">Sayles Hall</a>, it resembled an aircraft carrier. It remained in this unsatisfactory location, where cashiers sometimes had to wear boots when the floors were flooded, until <a href="./1951.html">1951</a>, when the shortage of dining facilities was ended with the opening of <a href="./Sharpe Refectory.html">Sharpe Refectory</a>.</p>
