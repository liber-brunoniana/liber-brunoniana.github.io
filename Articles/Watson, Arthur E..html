      <p>Arthur Eugene Watson (<a href="./1866.html">1866</a>-<a href="./1956.html">1956</a>), professor of engineering, was born in Providence on March 4, <a href="./1866.html">1866</a>. He graduated from Brown in <a href="./1888.html">1888</a>, and went to work with the Thompson-Houston Electric Company in Lynn, Massachusetts, and moved to Schenectady, New York, after the company became part of General Electric. He came back to Brown in <a href="./1895.html">1895</a> as instructor in physics. He was promoted to assistant professor in <a href="./1899.html">1899</a>. He founded a department in the new field of electrical engineering. His title was changed to assistant professor of electrical engineering in <a href="./1914.html">1914</a>, and associate professor in <a href="./1920.html">1920</a>. In <a href="./1924.html">1924</a> he designed the electrical plant for the airship Shenandoah. During <a href="./World War II.html">World War II</a> he designed electrical parts for Navy planes. After retirement in <a href="./1936.html">1936</a> he continued his research in electrical engineering projects, some of them for military purposes.</p><p>When Watson died on October 29, <a href="./1956.html">1956</a>, Professor <a href="./Tompkins, Frederick N..html">Frederick N. Tompkins</a> <a href="./1917.html">1917</a>, one of his students, wrote in the memorial minute for the faculty:</p><blockquote>“He was a capable engineer who combined to a marked degree the qualities of the theorist with those of the practical man. He was able not only to design apparatus and systems but to build them himself. This ability made him of great value during the developmental days of Electrical <a href="./Engineering.html">Engineering</a> and of particular value to his students. ... he was a gentleman and scholar of the old school. Greek, Latin, and the <a href="./English.html">English</a> of Chaucer came as readily to his mind as the intricate formulas and theories of Electrical <a href="./Engineering.html">Engineering</a>. He had a fine command of <a href="./English.html">English</a>, which, combined with a rather elfin sense of humor, made his lectures and informal talks a pleasure to listen to. By nature he was a very calm person, certainly not of the worrying type. He had great religious faith, which seemed to assure him that all would be for the best, no matter what happened.”</blockquote>
