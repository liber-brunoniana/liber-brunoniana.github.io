      <p>Vartan Gregorian, sixteenth president of Brown University, was unanimously elected at a special meeting of the <a href="./Corporation.html">Corporation</a> on August 31, <a href="./1988.html">1988</a>. Born in Tabriz, Iran, on April 8, <a href="./1934.html">1934</a>, he attended an Armenian-Russian school until he was fifteen, when he left Tabriz with fifty dollars and a letter of introduction from a French vice consul and entered the Collège Arménien in Beirut, Lebanon. In <a href="./1955.html">1955</a> he received a degree in Armenian studies. The next year he was awarded a scholarship for study overseas, and entered Stanford University. Studying through the summers, he received a bachelor of arts degree in history and humanities in two years. He earned his Ph.D. degree at Stanford in <a href="./1964.html">1964</a>, writing a dissertation on “Traditionalism and Modernism in Islam.” He taught at San Francisco State University from <a href="./1960.html">1960</a> to <a href="./1968.html">1968</a>. He won the Danforth Foundation’s Harbison Award for Distinguished Teaching in <a href="./1968.html">1968</a>, and in the same year became professor of history at the University of Texas at Austin. In <a href="./1972.html">1972</a> he was named Tarzian Professor of Armenian and Caucasian <a href="./History.html">History</a> at the University of Pennsylvania. The next year he was named faculty assistant to the president and provost, and served until <a href="./1980.html">1980</a>, when he resigned. A year later he became the president and chief executive officer of the New York Public <a href="./Library.html">Library</a>, which he restored from a declining institution to a financial and cultural success during the next eight years.</p><p>When Gregorian was awarded an honorary degree at Brown’s <a href="./1984.html">1984</a> <a href="./Commencement.html">Commencement</a>, the citation observed, “The lions who guard the steps of the <a href="./Library.html">Library</a> are named ‘Patience’ and ‘Fortitude,’ but when we consider your accomplishments, it is the courage of the lions that we are more apt to remember. We thank you for your inspired stewardship of one of the world’s great repositories of humankind’s accomplishments.” He was able to combine teaching with his presidency of the <a href="./Library.html">Library</a>, receiving appointments in <a href="./1984.html">1984</a> as University Professor of <a href="./History.html">History</a> at the New School for Social Research and as professor of history and Near Eastern studies at New York University. He accepted the presidency of Brown in <a href="./1988.html">1988</a>, arrived on campus in January <a href="./1989.html">1989</a>, and was formally inaugurated on April 9. Summing up his career for the <i>Brown Alumni Monthly,</i> he said:</p><blockquote>“A reporter from the <i>Times</i> asked me, ‘Would you have imagined that one day you would be president of an <a href="./Ivy League.html">Ivy League</a> university?’ And I told him, ‘If in <a href="./1956.html">1956</a> when I came to the States without speaking <a href="./English.html">English</a>, someone had told me I would finish a Ph.D. degree, that I would be a professor at University of Texas, that I would be the second foreign-born provost of the University of Pennsylvania (the first one, William Smith, was brought in by Benjamin Franklin), that I would have the opportunity to be chancellor of Berkeley, that I would be the first foreign-born president of the New York Public <a href="./Library.html">Library</a>, and finally the first foreign-born president of an <a href="./Ivy League.html">Ivy League</a> University, I would have considered that person to be crazy.’ But then I said to him, ‘You know, these kinds of things happen only in America.’”</blockquote>
