      <p>Owl and Ring was founded in <a href="./1926.html">1926</a> as a discussion group which evolved into a senior honorary society. Reports that the society was dedicated to promoting separate Brown and Pembroke commencements were denied in <a href="./1933.html">1933</a>, but surfaced again in <a href="./1935.html">1935</a> in <i><a href="./Bear Facts.html">Bear Facts</a>,</i> which added, “In spite of the impressive name, nothing further has been heard of this organization except once a year at the final Class Sing in May, when new members are tapped by the outgoing berobed owls.” Two years later <i><a href="./Bear Facts.html">Bear Facts</a></i> stated that the organization had been started as a “hoax” and that the membership included both Brown and Pembroke students. In <a href="./1939.html">1939</a>-40 the society was enlarged and given definite functions, including the guardianship of the bear mascot and the direction of the <a href="./Campus.html">Campus</a> Sing and the Senior Frolic. In September <a href="./1941.html">1941</a> Owl and Ring was disbanded by the <a href="./Cammarian Club.html">Cammarian Club</a> for failing to live up to its resonsibilities.</p>
